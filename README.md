I am a Master’s student in Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University, with a solid foundation in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. My experience includes working as a Cloud Migration Engineer , where I applied machine learning models to optimize server migrations to AWS, ensuring seamless transitions with near-zero downtime. I’ve also gained hands-on experience in automation, having developed Ansible playbooks and Python scripts that significantly improved process efficiency.

With strong technical skills in Python, C++, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and cloud technologies like AWS and Azure, I am passionate about solving complex problems through innovative solutions. I’m well-versed in machine learning algorithms, including SVM, Logistic Regression, and Time Series Analysis, and I’ve applied these skills to projects ranging from predictive modeling to automation.

I am currently seeking 2025 summer internship opportunities in Software Engineering, AI, or related fields, where I can leverage my skills and experience to contribute to impactful projects.
